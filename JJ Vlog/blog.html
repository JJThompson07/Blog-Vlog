			<p> Opening up your group chat on Whatsapp to a friends post 
			<br> <blockquote>"Anyone fancy a couple of drinks at the Local?"</blockquote> <br>
			Instantly followed with a few of the other lads in the group agreeing to the pub and starting to arrange a time. <br>
			This, however, is not an innocent invitation to the pub. Every Lad knows that the pub will only be the start of the night, once a few cold ones have gone down, someone will pop up on their round and decide that shots or Jager Bombs are needed. <br>
			Everyone now knows that town is ivenitable, it was always inevitable!</p>

			 <p> Taxis arrive outside the pub, everyone finishes theirs drinks and make there way to the taxis.
				<br> <blockquote>"Anyone booked a table?"</blockquote> <br>
				Another phrase commonly used for the guys who like to splash their cash to try to attract the girls. <br>
				Turning up to the club and pulling a promoter to the side, one of us manages to sort a table, we then all walk straight through and right to the table. Vip bands are then thrown around whilst a few of the guys try to sort the drink for the table, handing the money over as if it was their own and not a share of everyone together. <br>
				Now the night really begins, the drinks arrive, everyone goes to the dancefloor to do their own thing returning to the table to keep themselves topped up and regroup.</p>

			 <p id="morning"> The next morning, everyone wakes up and looks at the whatsapp group where one of the lads has written:
				<br> <blockquote>"Story time boys..."</blockquote> <br>
				This is now where the best news of the night is shared, and the lads who cant remember what they were doing, find out the antics they got up to. <br>
				Most of the time the stories tend to focus on the lad that really over cooked it - "dick of the night" - and everyone rips into them. </p>
